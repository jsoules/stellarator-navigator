                This page presents plots of the devices in the QUASR database, filtered according to parameters of interest.
                You can show the filter controls by clicking the button, and hide them again with the &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; symbol.
                Filter controls are divided into plot controls and filter controls.
            </div>
            <div>
                The <span className="emphasis">plot controls</span> allow you to choose the variables used for the
                X- and Y-axes of the plots, as well as the variable used to color the dots. You can also separate
                the plots into rows and columns according to variables of your choice. Altogether, this allows the
                plots to display five dimensions of data.
                By default, the plots show the root of quasi-asymmetry error against total coil length, with dots colored
                according to the device&apos;s number of coils per half-period (NC/HP), and plots split into columns according
                to the number of field periods (NFP).
            </div>
            <div>
                The <span className="emphasis">filter controls</span> lie below the plot controls. They allow you to
                restrict the visible devices according to a range of descriptive variable values.
            </div>
            <div>
                Note that you can also zoom in to a particular region of the plots by dragging and selecting that region;
                this will update the filters currently used for the axes. By changing axes, you can drill down easily to
                those devices which are of most interest.

                The left-hand panel is a 3-D model of the device, and the computed surfaces of its magnetic field.
                You can zoom with the mouse wheel or click and drag to rotate the view. To move the image within
                the frame, click and drag while holding the control (or command) key.

                The 3D view also offers controls that let you show/hide different surfaces, change the color scheme
                used to show field strength, toggle whether the complete device is shown (vs only one period), and
                choose whether to show coloration for current strengths in the coils.

                In addition to the 3D visualization, this page also shows a plot of the device&apos;s iota profile,
                a complete description of the device parameters, and Poincar√© plots. Additionally, you can download
                the device data in VMEC or SIMSOPT format.
